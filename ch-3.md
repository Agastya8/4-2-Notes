### **Importance of Nonverbal Communication**

The importance of non-verbal communications is that it is not generally faked and in most cases is instinctive and is used to show emotions like anger, happiness, sadness, pleasure, anxiety, annoyance, hurt, curiosity, interest, and hope. Sometimes it is not easy to interpret non-verbal signals because it does not have any fixed meaning and might differ from individual to individual.

Non-verbal communication has been described as an effectual process because the message is delivered and communicated more accurately than verbal communication. It is a fact that when a person speaks it is not just with words as his whole body is involved somehow or the other. Suppose you meet a friend then the smile on your face is more radiant but if you see someone you are not comfortable with then your fidgety behavior will show your unease.

The non-verbal communication is not always intended and in most cases is an automatic or instinctive reaction because people are also less conscious about it than the verbal one. The importance of non-verbal communication is that it gives credence to the verbal one if both are synchronized at the time of speaking.

**Helps in Better Understanding and Communication**

Non-verbal mode of communication can exist with or without verbal communication and has a significant role in making a good impact. This interpersonal communication makes a strong and long-lasting impression that either compliments or can also contradict verbal communication with a glance or gesture.

The importance of non-verbal communication is that it begets a better understanding of individuals or even groups. Sometimes a person shows great self-confidence while talking verbally and it becomes impossible to determine any adverse nuances from his words. It is at this time that non-verbal communication proves a stroke of luck and helps the listener to come to a better understanding.

The posture of the speaker might be confident but he will leave certain signals showing his true intention, for instance, is there an eye contact and is his facial expression too calm and collected.

Is the non-verbal signals matching his verbal tone is an important question that the listener should pay close attention to if he is looking for the truth of the statements.

**Helps in different processes in Business**

It is a fact that non-verbal communication is mostly contextual in nature but without its help, verbal communication remains incomplete. In few cases, it is in itself a complete statement and you do not need words to put your thoughts across but mostly it is a companion of verbal communication so as to emphasize the importance of the situation. The business has numerous demands of its own and it is important for the owner or the management to have an upper hand in business dealings that can prove a blessing for them.

The importance of non-verbal communication is that it helps in numerous aspects of business for instance in the hiring process. During interviews, the human resource department can easily make assumptions during a face-to-face meet and determine which applicants they want to see in the next round.

Similarly, it is easier for the experienced managers or management team to decipher the expressions of other employees, for instance, are they maintaining eye contact or are squirming in their chair or is the employee showing an interest in the conversation or is he looking at his watch on a continuous basis? Non-verbal communication is a great indicator that depicts the truth about the intention and trustworthiness of an individual’s character.

**Helps to emphasize your main points**

Non-verbal communication is actually a silent form of sending a message to someone without using words or any form of speech. It is influential by nature and is often successful in grabbing the attention of its audience. When the non-verbal signal is contradictory to verbal communication remember it is the time to be cautious and to pay close attention to what is being said. It is a fact that even silence has a deeper meaning of its own.

A person can understand better if verbal communication is accompanied by non-verbal signals for instance when a person says he is having a headache it is natural for his hand to touch his forehead to indicate the extreme pain. Similarly, if a person is interested in pointing out to a certain part of a message he can deepen his tone and put a serious facial expression during that time to accentuate his point.

The importance of non-verbal communication during important conversations is that it can help to emphasize certain points that are vital to that conversation. Some signs like anger, smile or aggression can help a person in making a particular point easily.

**It is important in the workplace**

Depending upon the profession an individual has to spend a greater part of his day in his workplace. He has to take immense care of his non-verbal communication so that his actions or gestures are not taken otherwise. In order to maintain a cordial workplace relationship, a person needs to show his enthusiasm for the job through an exciting look instead of a monotonous facial expression.

Remember it is the non-verbal signal that actually gives out the accurate vibes about your feelings to others hence put a smile on your face while entering the workplace, nod when listening to others and maintain eye contact to show that you are interested in whatever is spoken to you.

The importance of non-verbal communication is that it is a great help in maintaining workplace efficiency.

### <mark style="background-color:green;">3. Discuss the effective ways to improve communication</mark>



with the rise of social media networking and texting, communication is becoming more casual, even in situations where more formal ways of communicating are required. What this means is that people from the younger generation, may not know or even understand the importance of effective communication skills in the workplace. When you take a look at the greatest leaders, one of the traits they possess, is the ability to communicate effectively, which underscores the importance of communication skills.

There are specific things to do that can improve your communication skills:

**1.  Listen, listen, and listen**. People want to know that they are being heard. Really listen to what the other person is saying, instead of formulating your response. Ask for clarification to avoid misunderstandings. At that moment, the person speaking to you should be the most important person in your life. Another important point is to have one conversation at a time. This means that if you are speaking to someone on the phone, do not respond to an email, or send a text at the same time. The other person will know that she doesn’t have your undivided attention.

**2.  Who you are talking to matter**s. It is okay to use acronyms and informal language when you are communicating with a buddy, but if you are emailing or texting your boss, “Hey,” “TTYL” or any informal language, has no place in your message. You cannot assume that the other person knows what the acronym means. Some acronyms have different meanings to different people, do you want to be misunderstood? Effective communicators target their message based on who they are speaking to, so try to keep the other person in mind, when you are trying to get your message across.

**3.  Body language matters**. This is important for face-to-face meetings and video conferencing. Make sure that you appear accessible, so have open body language. This means that you should not cross your arms. And keep eye contact so that the other person knows that you are paying attention.

**4.  Check your message before you hit send**. Spell and grammar checkers are lifesavers, but they are not foolproof. Double check what you have written, to make sure that your words are communicating the intended message.

**5.  Be brief, yet specific**. For written and verbal communication, practice being brief yet specific enough, that you provide enough information for the other person to understand what you are trying to say. And if you are responding to an email, make sure that you read the entire email before crafting your response. With enough practice, you will learn not to ramble, or give way too much information.

**6.  Write things down**. Take notes while you are talking to another person or when you are in a meeting, and do not rely on your memory. Send a follow-up email to make sure that you understand what was being said during the conversation.

**7.  Sometimes it’s better to pick up the phone**. If you find that you have a lot to say, instead of sending an email, call the person instead. Email is great, but sometimes it is easier to communicate what you have to say verbally.

**8.  Think before you speak**. Always pause before you speak, not saying the first thing that comes to mind. Take a moment and pay close attention to what you say and how you say it. This one habit will allow you to avoid embarrassments.

**9.  Treat everyone equally**. Do not talk down to anyone, treating everyone with respect. Treat others as your equal.

**10.  Maintain a positive attitude and smile**. Even when you are speaking on the phone, smile because your positive attitude will shine through and the other person will know it. When you smile often and exude a positive attitude, people will respond positively to you.

Communicating effectively is a teachable skill, therefore following a few of the tips outlined above, will enable you to hone up on your communication skills.

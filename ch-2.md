### <mark style="background-color:green;">1.What are the three ego states according to transactional analysis theory? Describe them.</mark>

Transactional analysis (TA) is a theory developed by Dr. Eric Berne in the 1950’s that involves a set of practical conceptual tools designed to promote personal change and growth.

The goal of transactional analysis is autonomy, which is defined as awareness, spontaneity, and the capacity for intimacy. In achieving autonomy people have the capacity to make new decisions (redecide), thereby empowering themselves and altering the course of their lives.

**EGO STATES**

Every one of us displays behaviour which falls into one of three categories. Those categories are called ego states .

These states develop during the early years of our life and are influenced by those who are involved in our upbringing – usually our parents – and our responses to what happens to us. It is important to say at this stage that all three are required for a healthy existence and quality of life. In addition, each ego state has positive and negative aspects, which are described below.

**1. Parent Ego State**

The Parent ego state is created by the messages we receive from our parents. This means it is different for every one of us. My parents were different to yours and so the messages I received when I was growing up are different to the ones you received. A small child often has nothing else to do but take in the world around it. It tries to make sense of what is going on because every piece of information, every clue to appropriate behaviour can help with its survival. So, the child takes in huge amounts of information from its surroundings – in particular its parents. This information is internalised in the Parent ego state. It is divided into two parts:

Controlling Parent

This is the parent who tells us what to do. At its best, it provides us with vital advice and guidance on how to live our lives. At worst it manifests in stifling, critical behaviour.

Nurturing Parent

This is the parent who cares for us. When done properly we feel cherished and supported, but too much and we are smothered and not allowed to discover ourselves.

**2. Child Ego State**

In a similar way, our Child ego state represents how we felt as a child when growing up. It represents our joy, our creativity our worries and our fears. Again, it is divided into two distinct parts:

Adapted Child

This is the child that responds to the rules set out by our parents. Depending on the choice the child makes, it will either play by the rules or rebel. When a mother tells her son to sit up straight at the table, the child may do so because he knows his mother will be pleased with him. He will receive [strokes](https://www.c-volution.nl/blog/2011/03/19/20-minutes-in-20-years/) (attention) for his behaviour. Maybe, after a week of doing so his mother no longer notices and so in order to regain her attention, the child begins to slouch until his mother reminds him of the right way to sit (doing so, perhaps, using negative strokes.)

Natural Child

This refers to the way we behave when we are free and unrestricted by any rules. It allows us to be creative, joyous and carefree. However, if behaviour oversteps social boundaries it could cause embarrassment or offence.

**3. Adult Ego State**

It is the Adult ego state which allows us to interact with others without playing games. When we are in Adult we work without emotion to gather information, process it and act accordingly. A strong Adult ago state orchestrates the other ego states in a way which limits their negative effects, and makes use of the positive ones. It is this ego state we must seek out when we find ourselves in a (psychological) game. This means that when I am in an argument and reacting from the Child ego state (emotional), I must find a way to communicate from the Adult ego state (see Transaction Types, below).

**JOHARI WINDOW**

The Johari Window was invented by Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham in the 1950s as a model to understand ourselves better and how others understand us.

![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

![](file:///tmp/wps-agastya/ksohtml/wpsj1AF5o.png) **Open Area**

The model works using four area quadrants. Anything you know about yourself and are willing to share is part of your open area. Individuals can build trust between themselves by disclosing information to others and learning about others from the information they in turn disclose about themselves.

**Blind Area**

Any aspect that you do not know about yourself, but others within the group have become aware of, is in your blind area. With the help of feedback from others you can become aware of some of your positive and negative traits as perceived by others and overcome some of the personal issues that may be inhibiting your personal or group dynamics within the team.

**Hidden Area**

There are also aspects about yourself that you are aware of but might not want others to know, this quadrant is known as your hidden area. This leaves just one area and is the area that is unknown to you or anyone else – the unknown area.

By working with others it is possible for you to discover aspects that neither of you may never have appreciated before. Some examples of unknown factors can be as follows: an ability that is under-estimated or un-tried through lack of opportunity, encouragement, confidence or training a natural ability or aptitude that a person doesn't realise they possess a fear or aversion that a person does not know they have an unknown illness repressed or subconscious feeling conditioned behaviour or attitudes from childhood

As I share more and gain more information about myself I begin to gain insights through introspection about aspects of myself that both I and others were unaware of, things like impulses that drive us, motives and instincts, those less tangible things that we just accept but haven’t given much thought to. These insights help move information from the unknown quadrant into the OPEN

### <mark style="background-color:green;">4.Explain the difference between self-efficiacy and self-esteem</mark>

**Self esteem**

Though mostly confined to psychology, self esteem has become a very popular word today and commonly refer to people having a high self esteem or low self esteem. Self esteem is a concept that refers to a person’s overall evaluation of himself. It is an appraisal of one’s own worth. There is no scale to measure self esteem but you can tell whether a person has a high self esteem or low self esteem by his behavior and reaction to his environments. Self esteem is the opinion one has about himself. People having high self esteem have a good self image and such people believe that they are good, reliable, hardworking, honest and friendly to others. Self esteem is just like a mirror in which you can see your qualities just as you see your image in a mirror.

However, those having a low self esteem are the people who are timid, shy, introvert, and non competitive. Such people believe that others are better than they are and despite wearing the best of clothes will feel awkward and feel that others are better dressed than they are. People with low self esteem never realize their potential and are condemned to live a sub standard life, at least inwardly. Self esteem is a crucial and vital to have a positive attitude towards life and others. Low self esteem translates into poor self confidence which causes people to have negative feelings and such people are likely to give up challenges rather easily.

**Self efficacy**

Self efficacy is a concept related to self esteem. It was introduced by Albert Bandura. If you have heard about locus of control, you will easily understand this term. It is an assessment of an individual about his ability to perform a task or face a situation. This is one feeling that builds up as you go on learning and mastering different abilities in life. In fact, self efficacy is a strong belief in your own ability to do succeed against all odds. If you have a strong belief in your ability to learn new things, you tend to develop a feeling of self efficacy.

**Self-esteem vs Self-efficacy**

A person may not know ball dancing and may have a low self efficacy for ball dance, but that doesn’t result in a low self esteem if he does not think of ball dance being important in his life. Thus you can see that self esteem is different from self efficacy. Self esteem is a permanent internal feeling while self efficacy is a feeling that depends upon the performance at hand. Had they been the same, you would have been on a high one day and felt terribly the very next day when confronted with a task that you did not have the ability to perform. Similarly, you know that success or failure at one task does not affect your self esteem. You know that you are worth more than a performance or more.

### <mark style="background-color:green;">5.Write briefly about Big 5 Personality theory.</mark>

THE BIG FIVE PERSONALITY MODEL

The big five model of personality or popularly known as the ‘Big Five’ is a part of ‘Trait theories of

Personality’. Earlier trait theories illustrated variety of possible traits. Some of the popular theories are “Gordon Allport's list of 4,000 personality traits, Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors, and Hans Eysenck's three-factor theory. The five core personality traits theory has been supported by many researches such as D. W. Fiske (1949), Norman (1967), and Goldberg (1981). Robert McCrae and Paul Costa (1987) later developed the Five-Factor Model, or FFM, which describes personality in terms of five broad factors.” The big five personality model describes the essential traits that are the fundamentals of personality of a person. Curiously, all five personality variables indicate a variation between two extremes, i.e. high or low. Individuals in the real world normally fall between these two extremes somewhere in between.

The five factors of this model or fives traits of the personality are:

1\. Agreeableness

2\. Extraversion

3\. Conscientiousness

4\. Neuroticism

5\. Openness to experiences

&#x20;

1\. Agreeableness: It applies to one person's willingness to get along with others. The trait is characterized by confidence, collaboration, compassion and empathy. Those who are highly agreeable value harmony more than just having a say or a way. They're cooperative, and trust other people. People who concentrate more on their own needs than on acceptability needs of those who are weak.

&#x20;

Note: The acronym CANOE (for conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion) is helpful while remembering the big five personality traits.

2\. Extroversion: It represents the degree of comfort a person has with relationships. Extroverts are sociable, talkative, assertive and open to new relations. Introverts are less sociable, less talkative, less assertive, and more reticent about beginning new relationships.

3\. Conscientiousness: This trait refers to the number of targets a person is focusing on. At one point, a person of high conscience focuses on very few goals. Such individuals are believed to appear to be well organized, cautious, responsible, self-disciplined, and centered. A person with low conscientiousness tends to be less concentrated, and at one time may seek to accomplish several goals.

4\. Neuroticism or Emotional stability: This personality trait centers on the ability of an individual to cope with stress. Emotionally stable individuals tend to be calm, enthusiastic and secure. The emotionally unstable person, on the contrary, appears to be anxious and deprived with insecurities.

5\. Openness to Experiences: Creativity and innovation intrigue especially transparent humans. They 're willing to listen to new ideas in reaction to new knowledge, and change their own ideas, beliefs and attitudes. At the other hand, those with low levels of transparency tend to be less inclined towards new

ideas and less likely to change their minds, respectively. These do seem to be less adventurous and have less and fewer focused interests.

The “Big Five” framework is considered valuable for managers as study of these personality dimensions give them with the power to predict the behavior of individuals in certain situations.

However, there are many demographic, cultural, and environmental factors that influence the Big Five traits. These factors should be taken into consideration while taking decisions based on The Big Five Personality dimensions.

### <mark style="background-color:green;">6.Discuss Herzberg theory of motivation</mark>

Herzberg’s two-factor theory

This is also known as motivation-hygiene theory. Herzberg was a psychologist and he believed that, an individual’s relation to work is basic and ones attitude towards work can determine success or failure. He got the response for his questionnaire answered by several employees. His intention was to identify what the employee’s want from their job.

He also expected from them the situation in which they felt exceptionally good or bad about their jobs. This resulted into certain characteristics constantly related to job satisfaction and others to job desertification. Factors that lead to extreme dissatisfaction, in order of merit in terms of frequency where organizational policies and administration, type of supervision and the relation with supervisor, work environment, salary followed by comparatively low factors like status, personal relationship, etc. Alternatively, the factors relating to high satisfaction included similarly in order of importance achievements, recognition, work involvement, responsibility as well as advancement and growth. 69% of factors contributing to dissatisfaction were hygienic in nature. And 19% hygienic factors contributing to job satisfaction were hygienic in nature, the remaining factors in both the categories were respectively 31% and 81% and were motivator factors.

Herzberg argued that the response strongly indicated that opposite of satisfaction is not dissatisfaction because removing dissatisfaction characterizing does not necessarily make the job satisfying. Therefore, his conclusion was that, job satisfaction factors are separate and distinct from those that lead to job dissatisfaction. And therefore elimination of factors for job dissatisfaction by managers may not necessarily help or create motivation. And therefore conditions around the job such as supervision quality, pay, company policies, physical working condition, relations with other and jobs security are called hygiene factors.

In the present context, many of these factors have depleted to a great extent. Similarly, the other side of the two factor theory also is becoming mild and therefore this theory may not carry as much vantage as it did during the twentieth century. The critiscism on this theory perhaps as indicated below may also be one of the factors for curtailing its importance at present. It is as indicated below.

i. Herzberg procedure is limited by his methodology because people generally take credit themselves when things go well and blame failure on extrinsic environment.

ii. No quantitative satisfaction asserting an employee may dislike a part of his job yet he thinks it is acceptable.

iii. The theory ignores situational factors and is said to be not in line with the early research.

iv. His theory does not give high profile of reliability because special efforts are to be made by the researchers in interpretation of the responses.

v. Herzberg assumed a relationship between satisfaction and productivity but he looked only at satisfaction and not productivity in research methodology he adopted.

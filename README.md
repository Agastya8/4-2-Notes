**Long Questions**&#x20;

### 1. What are the major characteristics of diversity?

#### Characteristics of Diversity

Diversity has a lot of characteristics that depend on the cultural and socio-economic factors. Moreover, diversity in the workplace and classrooms promotes growth and a sense of empathy. It brings about newer perspectives and encourages tolerance. While some characteristics of diversity include age, gender, the color of the skin. There are other major ones which remain unseen.

\
**The following are the characteristics of diversity:**

• Linguistic Diversity\
• Regional Diversity\
• Religious Diversity

#### Linguistic Diversity

Linguistic diversity encompasses different types of qualities which comprise of language, grammar, and vocabulary of a person. The world is full of billions of people who speak thousands of languages. A specific country only has more than a thousand languages alone. Similarly, the tribal groups or ones which are more isolated from the world are likely to speak a different language. Linguistic diversity helps in measuring the density or concentration of a certain language in different areas. When the linguistic traits of certain groups or communities are shared amongst one another, it results in the development of a language family. In similarity to a biological family, a language family comprises of languages that constitute the common elements. Linguistic diversity is one of the major characteristics of diversity that form an important part.

#### Regional Diversity

While diversity is the acceptance of all folks regardless of their ethnicity, sex, education, disability, regional diversity constricts this acceptance to a group of people from a certain region or area. Being one of the key characteristics of diversity, regional diversity is an indication of each person’s uniqueness from a certain area. It refers to the differentiation of various communities, gender, ethnicity and more. For instance, India has great regional diversity. The country has mountains, sea coasts, deserts, plain areas and more. This is why it makes India a very regionally diverse country.

#### Religious Diversity

Religious diversity refers to the fact that there are different religions and the religious beliefs of people vary. If we look at the figures, there are roughly four thousand plus religions all over the world. Yet, people live peacefully with each other to an extent because of religious diversity. This comes in the list of characteristics of diversity that makes diversity a successful concept. As there is more and more awareness being spread all over, people are becoming religiously diverse. For example, India’s religious diversity is quite famous worldwide. The main religions of the country are Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism and more. Thus, religious diversity helps people in making them aware of other people’s religious beliefs and practices. It makes people more tolerant and open-minded.

In conclusion, we know by now that diversity comes in many forms. All of the characteristics of diversity contribute to each person’s unique experience. It brings together people from various walks of life together. This helps in generating ideas and perspectives which one may have not considered before. Moreover, it will help you develop socially as well. Most importantly, diversity helps in bridging the gaps of discrimination. In addition to tolerance, it also makes you accept people for their uniqueness and individuality. Therefore, it enriches a person’s life and makes them a global citizen.

### 2. Explain briefly the process of impression management.

Impression management is a conscious or unconscious effort towards influencing the perceptions, decisions and opinions of other people. In simpler words, it is a process of controlling or managing impressions of others in social interactions. Let’s look at some of the types and examples of impression management to understand the concept.

There are two primary types of impression management.

1. #### **CONSTRUCTIVE: ONE THAT HELPS IN THE FORMATION OF SELF-IDENTITY.**

We see the success of constructive impression management in the advertising world. Take Starbucks, for example. It’s considered ‘cool and hip’ when you purchase a chai tea latte.

1. #### **STRATEGIC: ONE THAT HELPS IN ACHIEVING INTERPERSONAL GOALS.**

We see maximum instances of strategic impression management in our professional lives. Whether you’re attending a job interview, interacting with a client or attending a conference—you dress appropriately and regulate your tone and language accordingly.

IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES

Impression management is a valuable tool that helps you engage in strategic behavior, but it can get tricky. Learn to differentiate between constructive and destructive impression techniques before you engage with people. Here’s a list of seven common techniques that we use in everyday life.

#### 1. **CONFORMITY:**&#x20;

It’s the act of matching your behavior with the group or environmental norms and attitudes. For example, students need to conform to a set of rules while they’re present on school grounds or in the classroom.

#### 2. **EXCUSES:**&#x20;

They generally refer to an explanation that cushions the consequences of a negative or unacceptable event. For example, we may make excuses when we’re late to work.

#### 3. **ACCLAIM:**&#x20;

It means to proudly and openly acknowledge somebody when they do their work properly or correctly. For example, in team feedback sessions, managers give employees who are doing a good job a pat on the back.

#### 4. **FLATTERY:**&#x20;

To excessively compliment someone to appear likable or perceptive is to flatter them. For example, if you want an extra serving of food, you may compliment and flatter the chef.

#### 5. **SELF-PROMOTION:**&#x20;

To emphasize your best characteristics or downplay your weaknesses are some of the effective ways of promoting or advertising yourself. Social media influencers are widely known for self-promotion.

#### 6. **FAVORS:**&#x20;

To do something nice for others to receive approval or acceptance is to do a favor. For example, you may take on some extra work so that your coworker can attend their child’s school play.

#### 7. **ASSOCIATION:**&#x20;

Sometimes we associate with certain people to protect or promote our self-image. For example, people network at conferences so that they can reach out to more people in the industry later.

### 3. What are attribution errors?

**Attribution theory**&#x20;

People make sense of their surroundings on the basis of what they consider is the cause and what is the effect of phenomenon it suggest that individuals observe their own behaviour or experience, try to figure out what caused it , and then (whether or not their conclusion is in fact correct)shape their future behaviour accordingly For example, if a consumer has had bad experience with locally made product (and good experience with an imported one) he or she may conclude that the bad product is bad because it is locally made.

**Attribution error**&#x20;

When people make an attribution, they are guessing about the cause of events or behaviours. These guesses are often wrong. People have systematic bias which lead them to make incorrect attributions.

**The Fundamental Attribution Error**&#x20;

The fundamental attribution error is the tendency to attribute other people's behaviour to internal factors such as personality traits ,abilities, and feelings. The fundamental attribution error is also called the correspondence bias, because it is assumed that other people's behaviour corresponds to their personal attributes. When explaining their own behaviour , on the other hand , people tend to attribute it to situational factors.

**actor observer bias**\
There is a pervasive tendency for actors to attribute their actions to situational requirements, whereas observers tend to attribute the same actions to stable personal dispositions

**Self Serving Bias**&#x20;

The self serving bias is the tendency to attribute success to internal factors failures to situational factors. This bias tends to increase as time passes after an event. Therefore the further in the past an event is, the more likely people are to congratulate themselves for success and to blame the situation for failure.

**Ultimate Attribution Error**&#x20;

The tendency to make more favourable and flattering attribution about members of ones group then about members of others group. In effect its is a self serving attribution bias at the group level.



### 4. Discuss briefly Hawthorne studies

The Hawthorne studies: A study undertaken at Western Electric Company’s

Hawthorne works in Chicago between 1927 and 1932 under the direction of Harward psychologist Elton Mayo, concluded that a worker’s behaviour and sentiments were closely related, that group influences were significant in affecting individual behaviour, that group standards were highly effective in establishing individual worker and it put that money was less a factor in determining worker output than group standards, sentiments and security. The Hawthorne researchers began by examining the relation between the physical environment and productivity.

Illumination, temperature and other working conditions were selected to represent this physical environment. They began with illumination experiments with variou groups of workers by manipulating the intensity of illumination upward and downward and noting changes in output. Results varied, but one thing was clear. In no case was the increase or decrease in output in proportion to the increase or decrease in illumination. As a follow up to the illumination experiments, the researchers began a second set of experiments in the relay assembly test room at Western Electric.

A small group of women were isolated away from the main work group for careful observation under the research assistant who acted as an observer — keeping records of output, rejects, working conditions and a daily log sheet describing everything that happened over 21⁄2 years period. This small group’s output increased steadily as did its morale. What became evident was that, this group’s performance was significantly influenced by its status of being a “special” group. The women in the test room thought being in the experimental group was fun, that they were in sort of an elite group, and that management was concerned with their interest by engaging in such experimentation. A third experiment in the bank wiring observation was similarly designed for male workers. In addition, a sophisticated wage incentive plan was introduced as the assumption that individual workers will maximize thei productivity when they see that it is directly related to economic rewards. The most important finding was that employees did not individually maximize their outputs, rather their output became controlled by a group norm that determined what was a proper day’s work. Output was not off by being restricted, but individual workers were giving erroneous reports. Interviews determined that the group was operating well below its capability and was leveling output in order to protect itself.

They helped each other to ensure that their reports were nearby the level. The norms that the group established included a number of “don’ts”. Don’t be a rate buster, turning out to much work Don’t be a chiseler, turning out too little work. How did the group enforce these norms? Their methods included sarcasm, name calling and ridicule. Members would also ostracize individuals whose behaviour was against the group’s interest.

The Hawthorne studies made an important contribution to understanding of group behaviour — particularly to the significant place that norms have a place in determining individual work behaviour.

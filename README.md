The Hawthorne studies: A study undertaken at Western Electric Company’s

Hawthorne works in Chicago between 1927 and 1932 under the direction of Harward psychologist Elton Mayo, concluded that a worker’s behaviour and sentiments were closely related, that group influences were significant in affecting individual behaviour, that group standards were highly effective in establishing individual worker and it put that money was less a factor in determining worker output than group standards, sentiments and security. The Hawthorne researchers began by examining the relation between the physical environment and productivity.

Illumination, temperature and other working conditions were selected to represent this physical environment. They began with illumination experiments with variou groups of workers by manipulating the intensity of illumination upward and downward and noting changes in output. Results varied, but one thing was clear. In no case was the increase or decrease in output in proportion to the increase or decrease in illumination. As a follow up to the illumination experiments, the researchers began a second set of experiments in the relay assembly test room at Western Electric.

A small group of women were isolated away from the main work group for careful observation under the research assistant who acted as an observer — keeping records of output, rejects, working conditions and a daily log sheet describing everything that happened over 21⁄2 years period. This small group’s output increased steadily as did its morale. What became evident was that, this group’s performance was significantly influenced by its status of being a “special” group. The women in the test room thought being in the experimental group was fun, that they were in sort of an elite group, and that management was concerned with their interest by engaging in such experimentation. A third experiment in the bank wiring observation was similarly designed for male workers. In addition, a sophisticated wage incentive plan was introduced as the assumption that individual workers will maximize thei productivity when they see that it is directly related to economic rewards. The most important finding was that employees did not individually maximize their outputs, rather their output became controlled by a group norm that determined what was a proper day’s work. Output was not off by being restricted, but individual workers were giving erroneous reports. Interviews determined that the group was operating well below its capability and was leveling output in order to protect itself.

They helped each other to ensure that their reports were nearby the level. The norms that the group established included a number of “don’ts”. Don’t be a rate buster, turning out to much work Don’t be a chiseler, turning out too little work. How did the group enforce these norms? Their methods included sarcasm, name calling and ridicule. Members would also ostracize individuals whose behaviour was against the group’s interest.

The Hawthorne studies made an important contribution to understanding of group behaviour — particularly to the significant place that norms have a place in determining individual work behaviour.
